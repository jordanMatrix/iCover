# iCover
Enable generating code coverage for server side (integration) tests concisely. Concisely means coverage data is separated
* from non-test traffic,
* by test runs and
* by test case.

In many instances broader integration tests (aka "end-to-end tests") are run with the software deployed server side (or serverless-side), i.e. in a "real" environment with actual remote dependencies running and with a port to listen on or being triggerable as in production. This project addresses the need to also have code coverage data collected and visible for those. A lot of times coverage data for those kind of tests is lacking. Since there is a growing trend / shift towards more 

## Main challenges and how we solved them
Here we briefly introduce what the main challenges are / were in realizing the above goal.


### Detect test traffic
* How? Request ID, some other header / content?
* Source IP filtering?
* Make mechanism pluggable / extensible to allow providing an own impl

### Reset and group together coverage for different test runs
* When is a test run finished?? Hard to say automagicallyâ€¦
* Per test case / suite coverage resolution

### Produce coverage results for on-going test runs

### Submit coverage data
* Where? How?

### Serverless?
* All of the above how?

### Make configuration pluggable
* supplied implementations: simple file based, some Spring-repo-based
